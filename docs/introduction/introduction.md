# Introduction

Digital Disbursements is a payment platform that enables your business to send payments to your customers. The digitized payments reduce the friction and time required for your customers to receive the money.

Fiserv’s Digital Disbursement product allows merchants to provide customers with fast, secure, and cost-effective payout options, how and when they want – on weekends, holidays and after hours. Likewise, the product allows the recipient to select the method to be used to disburse the payment.
