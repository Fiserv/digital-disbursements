# Recipient 

Digital Disbursement clients are allowed to determine if the recipient should be allowed to register on the recipient portal or not.  Typically, the decision is based on the number of times that a consumer/business is expected to receive a payment. 

DDP allow two types of recipient flow.

•	Guest 

•	Register

### Guest

If the payment is a one-time event, then the guest option is used.  

### Register

If more than one payment is expected to be sent to the recipient, then registration is requested.

## Multiple Recipient Payments

Recipients determine who will receive the funds:   If this option is being used, then the first recipient to enter his/her disbursement information will receive all of the funds.  The remaining recipients will have to approve the disbursement to the recipient receiving the funds prior to the completion of the disbursement.  If the payment expires before all recipients have approved or a recipient rejects the payment, then the payment is cancelled, funds are released in the DFA, and recipients are notified of the expiration.
