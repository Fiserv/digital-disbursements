# PORTAL Flow

The Digital Payouts Recipient Portal is a platform that allows customers to quickly and securely collect payments you’ve issued to them. The user-friendly platform guides customers through the process of claiming funds and allows them to choose among various payout options that would give them access to their money in a matter of minutes or days, depending on the payout method selected.

## The Process

Once a client initiates a payment to their customer, our system kicks off a notification letting the customer know their payment is ready. The notification contains the client’s branding and information related to the payout that the customer would recognize—their claim number, payment number, etc. This helps instill trust in the email communication.  The customer is then authenticated through the system and is guided through the process of accepting their money either as a Guest or Registered User. With the ease of this portal, customers will be able to accept a payment in 6 easy steps: 

1.	Clicking ‘Select Payment Method’ in the email notification
2.	Entering the one-time passcode emailed to them
3.	Entering their phone number for authentication
4.	Approving the payment amount
5.	Selecting a payout method and entering accurate account information to collect their money
6.	Clicking ‘Submit’
