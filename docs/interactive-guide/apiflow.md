**<ins> Header Description </ins>**

The header of Each API call will contain several parameters. It is important that each parameter contain the specified values to have a successful API Call. Any changes to the values will be noted through out the guide.

<!-- theme: success -->
>| Key               | value            |
>| ----------------- | ---------------- |
>| Content-Type      | "application/json" |
>| Client-Request-Id | Any unique ID, usually a guid. Must be unique per each request |
>| Api-Key           | Your Sandbox **KEY** goes here |
>| Authorization     | "HMAC " followed by the Encrypted payload as signature, shown below |
>| Timestamp         | Current time in EPOCH notation |

**<ins> How to generate HMAC Signature </ins>**

**<ins> Description </ins>**

HMAC signature is used in all calls made to our API and is necessary to receive a successful response from the system.

**<ins> High Level Flow </ins>**

- Get and save the current time
- Identify and save the request method
- Take the environment key and append a colon along with the current time
- Save this as the current raw signature (key:time)
- Get and save the payload from the request
- If the request method is not POST, move directly to step 7.
- Encrypt the request payload using SHA256 and save it
- Take this encrypted payload, make it a string and then encrypt it using Base64.
- Take the raw signature from step 4, append a colon and the Base64 encrypted payload to it and save it.
- Take the raw signature and HMAC encrypt it using SHA256 against the environment secret.
- Finally take this encrypted raw signature, make it a string and then encrypt it using Base64 to produce the signature for the header.

```javaScript

var key = postman.getEnvironmentVariable('clientKey');
var secret = postman.getEnvironmentVariable('clientSecret');
var time = new Date().getTime();
var method = request.method;
var rawSignature = key + ":" + time;
var requestBody = request.data;

if (method != 'GET' && method != 'DELETE') {
    var payload_digest = CryptoJS.SHA256(requestBody);
    var b64BodyContent = CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(payload_digest);
    rawSignature = rawSignature + ":" + b64BodyContent;
}

var signature = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(rawSignature, secret);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable('time', time);
postman.setEnvironmentVariable('signature', CryptoJS.enc.Base64.stringify(signature));

```

## Create a Recipient

**<ins> Description </ins>**

Recipient is a end user who can gets the disbursement money in their accounts provided.

We have two types of recipients.

1. Consumer

2. Business

This request will create a recipient for card vaulting or payment purposes. The recipient can be either business or consumer depends on the merchant use case.
Create recipient is always the first step that needs to be taken to for any transactions or calls on the system. In this step we will register the recipient in our system with the unique identifier (merchantCustomerId ) i.e. the merchant unique random number for the customer.

## Update Recipient Info (Optional/Informative)

**<ins> Description </ins>**

This request will update the previously created recipient with the necessary information. This recipient is identified by the passed in `merchantCustomerId` in the url. Updates the specified recipient by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged.
The minimal request can be any single entity that requires updating, any of the objects or entities in the parameters of the create recipient schema will work here.

## Get Recipient Info

**<ins> Description </ins>**

This request will retrieve the information for a recipient based upon its valid `merchantCustomerId` passed in the URL. With this retrieve call you can get the detailed information of the previously created recipient.

## Save a Payment Method

**<ins> Description </ins>**

There are following steps require to save (vault) a payment methond for the recipient.

 1. Create a Public Token
 2. Create the Account Nonce Token (API or Hosted)
 3. Vault the paymment method


### Create a Public Token

**<ins> Description </ins>**

This request will generate a public key to be used in encrypting PCI data as well as a `tokenId` to be passed to subsequent calls through the header. This `tokenId` and the `publicKey` is valid for 20 minutes and after than its expired, you will use the public Key to perform encryption  on the account details as follow:

| Account Type | Items to Encrypt             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Debit        | Card Number, Month, and Date |
| ACH          | Acount Number                |

### Create the Account Nonce Token

<!--

**<ins> Description </ins>**

In this request you are going to encrypt your PCI (Payment Card Industry) data with the help of `publicKey` and `tokenId` generated in "Create a Public Token" API call in previous step. Once that is done you will pass that data into this call and receive a nonce token to be used in the upcoming step for account vaulting. Keep in mind the encrypted payload for each variable should be surrounded by `ENC[ ]` as shown in the examples.

### Vault a Payment Method

**<ins> Description </ins>**

This request will take our generated nonce token from previous step in the payload as well as the `tokenId` from Step 1 in the headers. Once this step is completed the payment method will be vaulted and an EV (Enrolment Vault) token will be generated. These tokens are specific to payment methods vaulted with Fiserv and are not to be confused with TA (TransArmor) tokens which are generated through other flows. This EV token can be non-expired tokens and can be used multiple times for that recipeient.
