## Create a Recipient

### Description
This request will create a recipient for card vaulting or payment purposes. This is always the first step that needs to be taken to do any transactions or calls on the system.
The merchantCustomerId field should be **your** (ie the merchantâ€™s) unique identifier for this customer and should be generated by you.
The same payment method cannot be saved to the same recipientId, which is generated in this step. The recipientId changes based upon the **email address** of the customer.
The accepted values for recipientIdentifier are: [Last_4_of_SSN, SPECIAL_CODE, ACCOUNT_NUMBER, DATE_OF_BIRTH, PHONE_NUMBER]. This is used in conjunction with other information to uniquely identify the consumer.
