### Vault a Payment Method

#### Description

This request will take our generated nonce token from previous step in the payload as well as the `tokenId` from Step 1 in the headers. Once this step is completed the payment method will be vaulted and an EV (Enrolment Vault) token will be generated. These tokens are specific to payment methods vaulted with Fiserv and are not to be confused with TA (TransArmor) tokens which are generated through other flows. This EV token can be non-expired tokens and can be used multiple times for that recipeient.
